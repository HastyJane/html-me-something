      <h3>How they came to be in Washington DC </h3>
      <p>"Japan gave 3,020 cherry blossom trees as a gift to the United States in 1912 to celebrate the nations' growing friendship,
        replacing an earlier gift of 2,000 trees that had to be destroyed due to disease in 1910. These trees were planted in Sakura 
        Park in Manhattan and lined the shore of the Tidal Basin and the roadway in East Potomac Park in Washington, D.C. The first
          two original trees were planted by first lady Helen Taft and Viscountess Chinda on the bank of the Tidal Basin. The gift was
          renewed with another 3,800 trees in 1965.[79][80] In Washington, D.C. the cherry blossom trees continue to be a popular 
          tourist attraction (and the subject of the annual National Cherry Blossom Festival) when they reach full bloom in early 
          spring.[81] Just outside of Washington, the suburb of Kenwood in Bethesda, Maryland, has roughly 1,200 trees that are
            popular with locals and tourists.[82]" quoted from https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cherry_blossom </p>

      <h3>US japanese relations</h3>
      
      <p>The United States established diplomatic relations with Japan in 1858. During World War II, diplomatic relations between 
        the United States and Japan were severed in the context of the war that followed Japanâ€™s 1941 attack on Pearl Harbor, Hawaii.
         After years of fighting in the Pacific region, Japan signed an instrument of surrender in 1945. Normal diplomatic relations 
         were reestablished in 1952, when the Supreme Commander for the Allied Powers, which had overseen the postwar Allied 
         occupation of Japan since 1945, disbanded. The Treaty of Mutual Cooperation and Security between Japan and the United States
          was signed in 1960. quoted from https://www.state.gov/u-s-relations-with-japan/ </p>

      <h3>My Experience</h3>
      
      <p>The photos you see are from my 2016 trip to the National Mall. I wish I had something more profound to say
        but I am afraid I do not. It was lovely to see the bloom, lovely to visit the capitol. I recommend the experience. </p>
